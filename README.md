A simple Simon Game equivalent using js and jquery (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game))

This project has been created as a challenge during the "The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp" Udemy course (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/).
Although the course provides several instructions along the way, the effort was made without looking at those instructions. A finished version was provided during the beginning of the section.
The project was developed using the colour combinations and the sounds provided, but other than that, it was through my own sense of how something like this could be built. Furthermore, there were things and details that were not to my liking, and because of that I modified or added certain parts of functionality, such as a set of instructions, a countdown to begin the game and the option of restarting via a button and not the press of a keyboard key.
